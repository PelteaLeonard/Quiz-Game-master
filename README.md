# Hello

Guess the capital! Is the game that I've created for my second project. I've chosen to make this game because I wanted to know that every people who plays this game to learn something from it.

## UX


My game is a great way to demonstrate the compentencies I would list on my resume or to talk about in an interview. During a job search, the game showcases my work to potential employers. 


### User Stories
-  As a participant, I can take a quiz as part of a course so that I can get feedback on how well I learned.
-  As a participant, I want quizzes where I can assess my learning. 
-  As a participant, I can get answers via text rather than audio so that I read rather than watch an answer.
-  As a participant, I want to change my estimate as long as the draw has not been completed so that I can change my mind.
-  As a participant, I want to be able to change my estimate up until the last person selects a card and all are shown so that so that I can change my mind based on information I hear
-  As a participant, I want to be able start a two-minute countdown timer that all participants can see so that I can limit the time spent discussing the estimates when I think weâ€™ve talked long enough. 


### Wireframes


I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for each page to show my consideration of how to make my website responsive. The links to the files are below:

- [home.html(md-lg-and-xl)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/home-page-xl.pdf)
- [home.html(sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/home-page-sm.pdf)
- [game.html(md-lg-and-xl)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/game-page-xl.pdf)
- [game.html(sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/game-page-sm.pdf)
- [(end.html(md-lg-and-xl)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/end-page-xl.pdf)
- [(end.html(sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/end-page-sm.pdf)
- [(highscore.html(md-lg-and-xl)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/high-score-page-xl.pdf)
- [(highscore.html(sm)](https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game/blob/master/static/wireframes/high-score-page-sm.pdf)

There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website.


#### Existing Features

**Home button** - Takes the user to the starting point of the game.

**Info button** - Takes the user to info section in my game where I wrote informations about the game.

**Next button** - Takes the user to the end game.

**Highscores button** - takes the user to the highscores list.

**Progress barr** - It shows how far you have gone with questions.

**Progress text** - It shows you how many questions have you done so far.


#### Features left to implement

- In the future I want to add more categories to the game where you can select which continent you want to play.
- In the future I want to shows which answer is wrong when you press the right choice and to shows the right choice when you select the wrong answer.


### Technologies Used
**Balsamiq** - I've used Balsamiq to create wireframes of my website before building the actual site.

**HTML5** - The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my game.

**CSS3** - The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my game.

**Git**  - I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.

**GitHub** - I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my game in a live environment.


### Testing

#### Responsive Testing

- I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.
- To test my whole website, I went through each page, feature by feature, and documented the results on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet also documents any responsive features and confirms that they work and appear as intended on different screen sizes.

### HTMl and CSS Validation
- I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTMl code.
- i used the[W3c CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.

### Deployment
The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:
Loaded the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace.

Initialised Git using the git init command.

Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the git add . command.

Committed the files to Git using the git commit -m "Initial commit" command.

Created a new repository in GitHub called 'monkees-milestone-project-one'.

Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace:

git remote add origin https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Quiz-Game.git

git push -u origin master

Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.

Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.

Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.

Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
